### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yurri. I am a data engineer, as well as a software enthusiast.
I've been in engineering since 2009. But actually, since 2000. Then, in 2003, I won the competition with the game "Tanks" in Ukraine. 

Now, I'm focusing on building data platforms and data pipelines.
I am more experienced in big data tools, but relational databases are very familiar for me too. In Big data, the typical tools I use are Spark, Hive, Airflow, Python, and SQL. I've finished projects in both on-premise and cloud envs. I believe I am great at writing SQLs (especially complex ones), and coding Pythonic applications. But, frankly speaking :), the impostor syndrome sometimes comes to me :)

In my portfolio, tens of completed projects. As an example, in the last project, I built ~20 end-to-end data pipelines that process from tens to hundreds million events daily. To achieve that, I used Spark, Hive, Python, and SQL, Vertica, Jenkins, sometimes jumped right in Scala applications, checked Kafka, Grafana, ELK. I modeled the tables, built ETLs, and prepared source-to-target stuff. Also, I led the team for 6 months.

Some of my pet projects:

# Project - A Tableau report showing different types of Charts, 2022
This report was a part of the process when I tried to figure out when to use each type of the most popular diagram types, especially in Tableau (bar chart, line graph, scatter plot, etc.). Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yuri6516/viz/TenClassicalChartTypes/DifferentChartTypes


# Project - Python GUI Application which boosts Advanced English vocabulary by immersion in the Environment, 2021
This project aimed to boost my advanced English vocabulary. For this purpose, I took the Oxford-5000 Advanced word list and prepared the Python GUI application, which shows youtube videos, especially when this word is pronounced and pushes me to recognize and type it. I used API requesting to youglish.com, developer.oxforddictionaries.com, and google Sheets and configured GUI in Python using Pyqt5 to do that.

# Project - A monitoring solution for the Event-based system, 2021.
This project was a home task from "Highload System Design" training. Here, I use Docker/Docker Compose to build a solution with InfluxDB, Grafana, and Web-server and configure their Grafana Dashboards to monitor the loading.

# Project - Machine Learning solution to label photos of Cats and Dogs, 95% accuracy, 2019
As homework in a 3-month Machine Learning training, I wrote a small neural network using Python Keras and Google Colab, a data set of 1000 photos of cats and dogs. This network could train on the test amount of data and then identify with accuracy 95% if it is a cat or dog in the photo. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted the code.
